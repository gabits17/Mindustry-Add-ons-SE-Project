US1:  
As a mod developer, I want to have a grasp of general game mechanics, so that I can understand suggestions made by me or other users.

US2:  
As a mod developer, I want to read the codebase so that I gain an understanding of the internal structure of the game.

US3:  
As a mod developer in a team, I want to define 3 new functionalities so that these can be implemented efficiently according to a structure.
