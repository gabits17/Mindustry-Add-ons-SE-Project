Despite the fact that the metrics names are not written, I enjoyed reading this report, since I was not aware about this metrics at all. Now I am. 

The metrics are well explained, defined and analysed (with percentage values), as well as the reason why to focus on them instead of the other ones in the metrics set.

However, I would suggest relating more the textual part to the charts, i.e., actually writing a paragraph about it. The report would become easier to understand.

Note: avoid using the same expression that much frequently, as "that said".
