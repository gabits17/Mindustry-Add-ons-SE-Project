I agree with the analysis made about the Dependency. It is clear to see how Vars is highly depended on. The other cases like *Tile.java* are also clear to understand that it is highly depended on and in the analysis that is brought up. One problem I have with the report can be the visibility of the graphs. Having the label names containing mindustry for each one makes them a bit to lengthy and could be cut so that it is more pleasing to the eye. Although necessary abbreviations or splitting up onto other graphs could help the reader.

I have updated the [CodeMetrics](Data/CodeMetrics.xlsx) data file to include simplified names, and updated the bar charts in the report to include these simplified names.
