# Review
In the first metric presented there is a lack of specificity as to in what level the metric is applied(method level, class level, project level), and also maybe if possible an overall analysis of the codebase with this metric, to check weather this is an isolated incident or if the problem persists throughout the codebase.

When it comes to the second metric all the comments above are essentially invalid and I think it is very complete and well presented.
