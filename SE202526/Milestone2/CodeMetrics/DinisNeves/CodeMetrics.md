## To-do
1. A data file with the collected metrics.
2. A report explaining the collected metrics.
3. Identification of potential trouble spots in the codebase. (Hint: look for the extreme
values in the collected metrics - boxplots, or other data visualisation techniques are useful
here).
4. A short discussion on how these metrics might relate to the identified code smells, where
applicable.


**Important: Each student should collect at least 3 metrics. Where appropriate, a metric can be collected at different levels (e.g. class vs method) and counted as 2 metrics analysis**

Collect the metrics on that metrics set and save them to a file (e.g. a spreadsheet)

Produce a visualisation of those metrics (e.g. with a chart, such as a bar chart or a box plot) to support the analysis.

Analyse the collected metrics, focusing on identifying values that are not normal (i.e., outliers and extreme values). In particular, it is common for software repositories to contain artefacts (e.g., classes) that stand out in these metric distributions due to having extreme values (e.g., a very high complexity compared to other classes). These classes can be identified by their metrics and are worthy of further scrutiny, as they are often much more complex than average classes. Indeed, they are commonly a good place to look for code smells and to focus testing efforts. The analysis of the metrics done by a student also assumes that the student has to do a bit of research on the chosen metrics so that the student can frame the analysis and interpretation of those metrics' values in light of the rationale that led to those metrics creation.

You should add metrics visualisation and discussion in the report (your MD file). The long tables with raw data values can be found in the Git repository if they don't fit easily into the report. Charts and their discussion should be in the report.
