# Review

First of all, I want to say that using the base code, as delivered in the beginning of the project was very smart and crucial to deliver the best report possible. I want to congratulate you for going out of your way and search even more about this Metrics.

With that being said, I agree that this plugin is prone to some error and doesn't always give the best consistency, even though, when I ran it to calculate this metrics, the values I received in my machine are the same Diogo has in the presented table.

This report shows a good understanding of the matter in question and the "Contemplating the results produced by a bad scope - Analysing Coupling Factor (CF)" was an aspect I didn't think of but a great add-on to this report. I think some "opinions" could be more assertive and the trouble spots have their own category, but that is not crucial and a more of a possible improvement

I have no further to say, just compliment my peer for his great work and his search.
