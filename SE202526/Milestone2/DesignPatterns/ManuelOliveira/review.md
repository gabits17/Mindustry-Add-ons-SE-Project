## Review of Strategy Design Pattern 

On this implementation of the **Strategy** design pattern, the **Strategy** interface is wrongly identified as the **Context** "interface". Another lacking aspect of this report is the absence of a reference to one the concrete strategies in the Context Class, and the class itself. These are majors problems that make this **not** a Strategy Design pattern.

Another topic is the lack of context and information about the said Design pattern that I think would be nice to add, but not entirely crucial, being an option to the author to consider.
