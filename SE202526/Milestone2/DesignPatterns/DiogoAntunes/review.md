## Review of Memento Design Pattern (3/11/2025)
- Gabriel Matias (67775)

The diagram has dependency arrows, with a \<\<use\>\> attribute. I believe those are
only used in a _Package Diagram_, _Class Diagrams_ do indeed have dependency arrows,
but I could not find any source that used them with \<\<use\>\>. Maybe I'm wrong about this.

About the pattern, it was expected that a game would have at least an implementation of **Memento**, 
Even if it is not entirely correct due to encapsulation issues.

Apart from the dependency arrow "\<\<use\>\>", I don't believe there is anything else to point out. The report is
well structured and easy to read.
