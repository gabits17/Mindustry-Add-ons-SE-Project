## Review of Memento Design Pattern
- Gabriel Matias (67775)

The diagram as dependency arrows, with a \<\<use\>\> attribute, i believe those are
only used in a _Package Diagram_, _Class Diagrams_ do indeed have dependency arrows,
but I could not find any source that used them with \<\<use\>\>. Maybe I'm wrong about this.

About the pattern, it was expected that a game would have at least an implementation of **Memento**, 
even if it is not totally correct, due to encapsulation issues.

Apart from the dependency arrow "\<\<use\>\>" I don't believe there is anything else to point out, the report is
well structured and easy to read.
