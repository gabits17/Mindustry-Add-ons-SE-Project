# Review

## Review of Composite

- Manel Oliveira (68547)

The additional information about the design pattern in the beginning is a nice touch.

In this example the composite pattern isn't perfect because the Effect class isn't an interface. Despite this I believe that the core principle still stands.

Other than that I think it is really well done and complete, especially the diagram.


## Review of Template

- Manel Oliveira (68547)

The Template in this case is quite evident, and with the code snippets and diagram, it is presented very clearly.

And I think that it is very important to note this pattern in this example specifically because it is used extensively throughout the codebase, and is very fundamental to the whole project.

The only negative comment I can make is that there are some images outside the Assets folder.



## Review of Strategy

- Manel Oliveira (68547)

The misspelling of the **AceleratorBuild** class made researching this design pattern fairly confusing. 

Other than that it makes good sense and seems to fit into the general purpose of this design pattern.
