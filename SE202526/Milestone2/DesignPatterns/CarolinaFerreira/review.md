## Review of Template

- Manel Oliveira (68547)

The Template in this case is quite evident, and with the code snippets and diagram, it is presented very clearly.

And I think that it is very important to note this pattern in this example specifically because it is used extensively throughout the codebase, and is very fundamental to the whole project.

The only negative comment I can make is that there are some images outside the Assets folder.
