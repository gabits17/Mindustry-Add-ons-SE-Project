In the **Choose Tile** category the actor cited is "Player" - I can't understand if it was on purpose.

The Diagram looks simple and it's easy to understand. The organization makes sense, both in the diagram and the report. I have nothing to say about the use cases or their relations.

Spelling mistakes: in the Redo section, "redoble" instead of "redoable"
