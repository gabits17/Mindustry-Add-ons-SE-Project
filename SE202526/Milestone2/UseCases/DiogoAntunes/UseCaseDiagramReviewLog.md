# Review
Because the images appear fully black to mee I was not able to evaluate or review anything too critical to this use case. I also tried opening the images standalone, and they also appeared fully black.
I also encountered this issue, and solved it by exporting the svg files to png and using that version instead. That said the problem might be with my IDE as I'm using IntelliJ.

### Review Response - Diogo Antunes
Viewing the svg on Github should resolve these problems.
