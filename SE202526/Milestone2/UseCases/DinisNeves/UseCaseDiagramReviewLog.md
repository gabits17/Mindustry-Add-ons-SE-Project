# Review

Since Dinis wrote "Unit Control / Command System", this system could easily be separated in *two systems diagrams*. I believe this would make both systems easier to understand, since its interactions are similar, *but crucially different*.

I highly suggest not writing only the action of the use case, as in the use case *Repair*. Repair what? The use case must answer this question, even if generically.

Avoid using the expression "*if possible*" everywhere. Since these are small descriptions, they should only be focused on the *success scenario* of the use case. Alternative scenarios would be specified in the complete use case template, as learned in class.
For example, in the Respawn use case, an alternative scenario is described. This should not be happening here.

I strongly recommend rewritting everything, to make this report cleaner and easier to understand textually. I also emphasize punctuation.
