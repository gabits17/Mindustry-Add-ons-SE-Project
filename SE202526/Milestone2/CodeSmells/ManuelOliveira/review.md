## Review of Message Chains Code Smell

First of all, maybe fix formatting using some sort of markdown writing tool,
Obsidian, most images are placed after the text, making the text difficult to read.

Maybe giving some sort of example solution, even if just a snippet of dummy code,
doesn't even have to work.
About the autogenerated code, professors told us that if the autogenerated code had some
sort of smells, we could try and delve a little more into the annotation processing
side. Although this is something that I doubt anyone in the team has experience with.

Apart from the formatting issues with the images, mentioned above, I don't think
there are any major issues with this report, only that it could maybe be extended a little more.
