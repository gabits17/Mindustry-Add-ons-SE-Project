### Review of Shotgun Surgery (03/11/2025)
Since all these classes extend the same class to provide some differing, but often overlapping effect, I'm not too sure this is similar
to the traditional example of shotgun surgery.

At least in this example, the separation of code seems somewhat justified as,
while similar, the for loops used and their inner logic differ enough that it wouldn't make sense to create templates.
The logic is already abstracted by using a bullet handler, so I feel further abstracting the logic might be difficult or read to unnecessary generalization.

### Commenting on the proposed solution
Merging the classes and using a switch statement would create a switch statements code smell, and the current implementation
is actually the solution to the code smell created by the proposed change.

As such, I don't necessarily find it to be a helpful alteration.

### Minor spelling mistakes and other things
"ays" instead of "ways"

The order of image labels is wrong:
The first image currently shows ShootBarrel, not ShootAlternate.
The second shows ShootHelix, not ShootBarrel.
The third shows ShootMulti, not ShootHelix.
The fourth shows the BulletHandler interface within ShootPattern, not ShootMulti.
The fifth shows ShootSine, not ShootPattern.
The sixth shows ShootSpread, not ShootSine.
The seventh shows ShootSummon, not ShootSpread.

## Review of Message Chains Code Smell (3/11/2025)

First of all, maybe fix formatting using some sort of markdown writing tool,
Obsidian, most images are placed after the text, making the text difficult to read.

Maybe giving some sort of example solution, even if just a snippet of dummy code,
doesn't even have to work.
About the autogenerated code, professors told us that if the autogenerated code had some
sort of smells, we could try and delve a little more into the annotation processing
side. Although this is something that I doubt anyone in the team has experience with.

Apart from the formatting issues with the images, mentioned above, I don't think
there are any major issues with this report, only that it could maybe be extended a little more.

### Minor Spelling mistakes
Therefor -> Therefore

## Review of Long Method (06/11/2025)
The Code Smell is particularly noticeable, given the size of the class.  
However, I think I'd describe the role of Events as responding to a Trigger or game event as opposed to a periodic
check for updates on game elements.

Since all achievements need to be defined I do agree there is little choice but to do something with this structure.
In regards to the proposed solution, I believe there are events with similar logic structure that could have their logic factorised into private methods
with the aim of reducing code duplication and line count. This is opposed to grouping similar logic within the method into private methods,
which should also be done.

Creating types of achievements might also be useful, but there's also "miscellaneous achievements" with no particular group to belong to,
so not subdividing achievements is also understandable.


## Review of Dead Code

The first problem with this code smell is not the report, but the fact that this code smell was not part of the ones taught in class and there wasn't a small explain about this code smell, an improvement I think would be useful. Due to this fact, I had to taught myself the Dead Code code smell, which is not entirely negative, but less productive.

With this said, I agree with Manuel's opinion, since the own developer of this code states ``"doesn´t actually do anything, reading calls add()"`` about the ``unitSpawn()``, as well as the given solution.
