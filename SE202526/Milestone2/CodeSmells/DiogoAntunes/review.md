## Data Class Review
- Gabriel Matias Falcão 67775

From what I read, this really looks like a simple case of a data class, and I totally agree with the proposed solution
of creating a record to pass these values around.

The only wrong thing I found in the review is a minor spelling mistake in the first paragraph, "do" should be "due".
