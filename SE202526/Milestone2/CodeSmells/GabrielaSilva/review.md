## Review of Duplicated Code
#### Author

#### Review
The attribution of **Duplicated Code** in this case is accurate, the block of code selected is clearly repeated, and seems to behave the same in all its occurrences. 
Even tho the quantity of repeated section that ends up being refactored for each new function is quite small, the code still benefits from this, and it should be done.
