# Software Engineering Project

This project consists of extending the Mindsutry game by adding at least three new features. The team had seven sprints to work on this project and used the Scrum methodology, with the role of Scrum Master rotating among team members each sprint.

The following features were developed and integrated into the game for our project:
- **Undo/Redo** (Ctrl-Z) functionality
- **Liquid Leaks** practical upgrade
- **Turret Targeting** add-on
- **Copy Schematics** via Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V key bindings

Users can test all these features by running the game directly from this repository.
In addition to the implementation, there are comprehensive technical reports documented with UML diagrams, detailing the system design and development process of all new features.
