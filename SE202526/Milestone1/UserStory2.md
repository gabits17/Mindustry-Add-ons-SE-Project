### User story

*As a USER WITH A BIG BASE, I want to know where there are water leaks in my base, shown on the minimap as soon as they occur (eg: enemy destroys pipe) so that I don't have to do so visually on the terrain since it becomes very busy.*

#### Notes

*- Update the minimap when an existing leaking pipe has an adjacent connecting pipe placed.*

*- Look for new leaks when pipe blocks are destroyed by the user or by enemies (and potentially buildings connected to pipes).*
