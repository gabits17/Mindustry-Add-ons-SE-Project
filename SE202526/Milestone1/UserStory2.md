### User story

*As a USER WITH A BIG BASE, I want to know where there are water leaks in my base, shown on the minimap as soon as they occur (eg: enemy destroys pipe) so that I don't have to do so visually on the terrain since it becomes very busy.*

#### Notes

*- Update the minimap when an existing leaking pipe has an adjacent connecting pipe placed.*

*- Look for new leaks when pipe blocks are destroyed by the user or by enemies (and potentially buildings connected to pipes).*

### Review

Gabriel Matias Falcão 67775

*This could be developed further as a sort of alert system, using the chat or some user interface, in which the player could sort between alerts (destroyed units, pipes, blocks...)*

Manuel Oliveira 68547

*The feature looks worth implementing if not too worksome for our timeframe.*
