### User story

*As a HIGHLY STRATEGIC PLAYER, I want to be able to change the targeting options of turrets and or units (change attack priority to, eg: stronger enemies, shields, bullets) so that my base's defense strategy is flexible according to my current needs.*

This functionality would definitly give a better taste for pvp enthusiasts. It might need testing to ensure it doesn't make the defese overpowered too soon in the game. We should also consider a clear display to let players change targetting settings easily during gameplay.
