### User story

I as an USER would like if the game had a redo and undo functionality, and maybe some other document like editing functionalities,
so that it may be easier to erase my errors, easily copy and cut sections of my factory without needing to save a schematic, OTHER THINGS TO ADD INTO SO THAT....
