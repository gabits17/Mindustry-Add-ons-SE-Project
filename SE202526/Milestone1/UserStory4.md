### User story

As an EXPERIENCED USER, I want to have access to a traversable history of
copied block selections that I can pick to paste,
so that I don't need to save quick changes as schematics (saved block selections).

#### Notes

Be able to traverse through a buffer of the most recent selections made.
Can select a selection from the history to paste.

Avoids saving an in-game schematic for smaller changes.
