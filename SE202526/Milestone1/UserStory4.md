### User story

As an EXPERIENCED USER, I want to have some way to backtrack or recover previous copy and cut actions, so that  I don't need to save multiple versions of blueprints (schematics) every time I make a change.

#### Notes

A sort of copy, paste buffer that would save the copies the player makes
