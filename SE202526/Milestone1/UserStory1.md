### User story

*As an EXPERIENCED USER, I would like if the game had a redo and undo functionality, as well as copy/cut/paste, so that errors can be efficiently deleted, and sections modified without needing to save a schematic.*

I can see this as a feature similar to snipping tool. It might be interesting to consider, in example, only deleting pipes and ducts in a certain mode to avoid destroying buildings when needing to reorganise pipelines.

There will be a challenge in the need to access the blocks copied / cut and the store them to be used later, pasted.
It is a functionality that the game lacks, moving by copying and cutting would be a welcomed (quality of life) feature that does not yet exist in the game.
